 ---****--- README file contains the latest modified code. All of the Cross-over and mutation functions are implemented and marked in the code with a comment box around them for experimentation. The test results for the contemporary version of the main.cpp is also in this repo, they are called in such manner; genetic_log_5_2, genetic_log_6_2. The tests until lenght 7 were able to produce (n-1)^2 length for the FSM's. 8 length didn't produce the result wanted.
