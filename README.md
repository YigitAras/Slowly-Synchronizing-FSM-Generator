# Main Code and Testing Code

The algo_tester.py is for generating results and applying tests to the existing code.

## Genetic_Generator
This is the code for the genetic algorithm and the main bulk of the program. This is the one that will be mainly modified.

## Greedy_Generator
This was a test case code and we have decided not to move forward with this code.

## Makefile
Invoking command `make all` will compile all the necessary code.

The codes are written mainly in C, but for ease of use some functionality have been added as C++ code.
